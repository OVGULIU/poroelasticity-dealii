* Adaptive Mesh refinement
* Solve for more than one time strep
* Add background stresses and pressure
* Assemble displacement should be one function
  in order to avoid computing gradients twice because they are still
  needed for correct BC's in the RHS function
  put flag rebuild_displacement_matrix
